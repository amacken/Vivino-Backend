For your 4th project, you will be making a full CRUD app built with a React frontend and a Rails backend. You have 24 hours to complete this project.

MVP - minimum viable product
Rails backend: Create a rails backend with all CRUD operations available across your models.
Must have at least one model
React frontend: Create a React frontend that consumes your Rails backend.
Deploy online: Your app must be deployed online to Heroku
Must be hosted on Github with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often!

Technologies Used:
For the back end of this project, I used Ruby on Rails to generate the majority of the files and structure for me.

Approach Taken:
Due to the extremely short time frame of this project, I tried to keep my project as simple as possible. I referenced materials and examples from our class and kept my styling simple enough to make sure I finished in enough time.

Unsolved Issues:
If given more time I would like to improve the styling and functionality of the project.
